##Introduction

Terapixel pictures offer an natural, open way to show data sets to partners, permitting watchers to intuitiveness browse enormous information over different scales. The challenge we tended to here is how to provide the supercomputer scale assets required to compute a practical terapixel visualization of the city of Newcastle upon Tyne and its natural information as captured by the Newcastle Urban Observatory. Our arrangement may be a scalable engineering for cloud-based visualization that we will deploy and pay for as it were as required. The three key goals of this work are to: form a supercomputer design for adaptable visualization utilizing the open cloud; create a terapixel 3D city visualization supporting every day overhauls; embrace a rigorous assessment of cloud super-computing for compute-intensive visualization applications. We illustrate that it is possible to deliver a high-quality terapixel visualization employing a way following renderer in beneath a day utilizing open IaaS cloud G

## About Data

A run using the 1024 GPUs resulted in the creation of the dataset which shows the performance timing of the render application, performance of the GPU card, and the details of which part of the image of the was being rendered in each task.

#### Description of variables:

timestamp: time stamp at which the IoT sensor captured the data

eventName: name of the event occurring within the rendering process

eventType: tells whether the event starts or stop

jobId & taskId: ID of the Azure batch job and task

hostname: Hostname of the virtual machine auto-assigned by the Azure batch system.

gpuSerial: The serial number of the physical GPU card.

gpuUUID: The unique system id assigned by the Azure system to the GPU unit.

powerDrawWatt: Power draw of the GPU in watts.

gpuTempC: Temperature of the GPU in Celsius

gpuUtilPerc: Percent utilisation of the GPU Core(s).

gpuMemUtilPerc: Percent utilisation of the GPU memory.

x: X co-ordinate of the image tile being rendered.

y: Y co-ordinate of the image tile being rendered.

level: Zoomable "google map style" map is created with 12 levels. You will only see levels 4, 8 and 12 in the data as the intermediate level are derived in the tiling process.

### Data Preprocessing

Data Preprocessing is a crucial step before proceeding with any analysis as presence of outliers, duplicate and wrong data affects the quality of the analysis' outcome.

1. All the available datasets are loaded and renamed accordingly for the ease of usability.

2. Removing duplicate entries from the datasets

3. Application checkpoints dataset and Tasks dataset both are merged and used to calculate the individual run times of each event, also linking the x and y tile values with their task ids and GPUs.


## Analysis of the Data

The prime focus of the analysis here has been on identifying how few GPUs have performed differently with respect to rest of the bunch, with the graphical summaries supporting the argument.










## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
